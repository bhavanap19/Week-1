PROBLEM STATEMENT 
With the rapid increase in urbanization and industrialization, waste generation has grown exponentially, leading to serious environmental and public health challenges.
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification model using the Garbage Dataset to automatically classify waste into 10 categories such as metal, glass, biological, paper, plastic, cardboard, trash, clothes, shoes, and batteries.
Support smart waste management systems, and promote environmental sustainability by reducing landfill waste and resource contamination.
